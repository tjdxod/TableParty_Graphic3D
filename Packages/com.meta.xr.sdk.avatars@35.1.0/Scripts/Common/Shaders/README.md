# Avatar SDK Shaders

We recommend using `Recommended/Avatar-Shader.shader` for your avatars. The shader configurations are connected to the avatars via the `AvatarSDKManager` prefabs in `/Oculus/Avatar2/Example/Common/Prefabs/AvatarSdkManager/`. Please see the `README.md` file in that folder for more details.

## Example

See the `LightingExample.unity` scene to toggle through the different shaders via the `AvatarSDKManager` prefabs.
